# Plotting Our Blocks

An understanding of the box model is necessary to complete this assignment efficiently, especially the difference between padding and margin.

Many new students disregard padding altogether and use only margin. As a rule of thumb, use padding when you want to push children inwards, and margin with you want to push siblings away.
